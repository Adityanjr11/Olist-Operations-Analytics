# E-commerce Exploratory Data Analysis (Olist)

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world e-commerce dataset to understand order trends, delivery performance, customer ratings, and revenue patterns.

The goal is to identify how delivery delays impact customer experience and business outcomes using Python.

## Objectives
- Analyze order and delivery trends  
- Compare on-time vs delayed deliveries  
- Study the impact of delivery delays on customer ratings  
- Examine revenue distribution across delivery status  
- Understand geographic distribution of orders  

## Dataset
Public e-commerce dataset from Kaggle, consisting of multiple CSV files:
- orders
- order_items
- order_reviews
- customers  

Datasets were merged using order_id and customer_id.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- A significant portion of orders are delivered late  
- Delayed deliveries receive lower customer ratings  
- Order volume varies month to month  
- Delayed orders contribute a meaningful share of revenue  
- Customer demand is concentrated in a few states
